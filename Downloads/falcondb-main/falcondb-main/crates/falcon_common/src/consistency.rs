//! Consistency Semantics Module for FalconDB.
//!
//! This module formalizes the consistency boundaries of the system:
//! - **Commit Points**: Logical, Durable, and Client-Visible commit stages.
//! - **Commit Policies**: Configurable durability guarantees per-transaction.
//! - **WAL Invariants**: Formal properties the WAL must uphold.
//! - **Replication Invariants**: Prefix property, apply ordering, ACK semantics.
//! - **Failover Rules**: Promote preconditions and post-promote guarantees.
//! - **Read Semantics**: Isolation levels and replica read staleness.
//! - **Error Classification**: Determinate vs indeterminate commit outcomes.
//!
//! Every invariant in this module has a corresponding test in the consistency
//! test suite (`tests/consistency_*.rs`).
